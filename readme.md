# SQL Employees Data Analysis

This repository provides a collection of SQL queries designed to analyze sample employees' data. The employee's dataset was used in a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-sql-databases-bootcamp-zero-to-mastery/?couponCode=MCLARENT71824) that explored SQL fundamentals through the analysis of four databases (Employees, France, Store, World). 
My project focuses on the Employees database to expand analysis provided in the course. It applies various SQL statements to investigate the following aspects of the data:

* Company Information: Average salary and job titles.
* Employee Information: Hire dates, age distribution, and employees working longer than 30 years.
* Dates: Birth dates of employees.
* Hiring: Number of employees hired on specific dates and number of senior-level employees hired after 1993.
* Departments: Number of employees per department and average salary per department.

The SQL queries are contained in a file named "Employees_queries.sql".

**Technologies:**

* SQL
* PostgreSQL
* Valentina Studio
